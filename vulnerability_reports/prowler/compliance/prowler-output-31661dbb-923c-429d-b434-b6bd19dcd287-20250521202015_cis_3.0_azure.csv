To handle the logon process, a choice from a set of identity providers can be made, or a custom authentication mechanism can be implemented.;By Enabling App Service Authentication, every incoming HTTP request passes through it before being handled by the application code. It also handles authentication of users with the specified provider (Entra ID, Facebook, Google, Microsoft Account, and Twitter), validation, storing and refreshing of tokens, managing the authenticated sessions and injecting identity information into request headers. Disabling HTTP Basic Authentication functionality further ensures legacy authentication methods are disabled within the application.;This is only required for App Services which require authentication.

To create an endpoint, run the following command:```az network private-endpoint create --resource-group <resourceGroup --vnet-name <vnetName> --subnet <subnetName> --name <PrivateEndpointName> --private-connection-resource-id '/subscriptions/<AZURE SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<keyVaultName>' --group-ids vault --connection-name <privateLinkConnectionName> --location <azureRegion> --manual-request```2. To manually approve the endpoint request, run the following command:```az keyvault private-endpoint-connection approve --resource-group <resourceGroup> --vault-name <keyVaultName> –name <privateLinkName>```3. Determine the Private Endpoint's IP address to connect the Key Vault to the Private DNS you have previously created:4. Look for the property networkInterfaces then id; the value must be placed in the variable <privateEndpointNIC> within step 7.```az network private-endpoint show -g <resourceGroupName> -n <privateEndpointName> ```5. Look for the property networkInterfaces then id; the value must be placed on <privateEndpointNIC> in step 7.```az network nic show --ids <privateEndpointName> ```6. Create a Private DNS record within the DNS Zone you created for the Private Endpoint:```az network private-dns record-set a add-record -g <resourcecGroupName> -z 'privatelink.vaultcore.azure.net' -n <keyVaultName> -a <privateEndpointNIC>```7. nslookup the private endpoint to determine if the DNS record is correct:```nslookup <keyVaultName>.vault.azure.netnslookup <keyVaultName>.privatelink.vaultcore.azure.n```";**Audit from Azure Portal**1.

The Azure Bastion service provides this access using TLS over 443/TCP, and subscribes to hardened configurations within an organization's Azure Active Directory service.;The Azure Bastion service allows organizations a more secure means of accessing Azure Virtual Machines over the Internet without assigning public IP addresses to those Virtual Machines. The Azure Bastion service provides Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Secure Shell (SSH) access to Virtual Machines using TLS within a web browser, thus preventing organizations from opening up 3389/TCP and 22/TCP to the Internet on Azure Virtual Machines. Additional benefits of the Bastion service includes Multi-Factor Authentication, Conditional Access Policies, and any other hardening measures configured within Azure Active Directory using a central point of access.;The Azure Bastion service incurs additional costs and requires a specific virtual network configuration.

Azure Storage accounts that use the classic deployment model will be retired on August 31, 2024.;The default network configuration for a storage account permits a user with appropriate permissions to configure public network access to containers and blobs in a storage account. Keep in mind that public access to a container is always turned off by default and must be explicitly configured to permit anonymous requests. It grants read-only access to these resources without sharing the account key, and without requiring a shared access signature.It is recommended not to provide public network access to storage accounts until, and unless, it is strongly desired. A shared access signature token or Azure AD RBAC should be used for providing controlled and timed access to blob containers.;Access will have to be managed using shared access signatures or via Azure AD RBAC.;**Remediate from Azure Portal**First, follow Microsoft documentation and create shared access signature tokens for your blob containers.

If the `Allow Azure services on the trusted services list to access this storage account` exception is enabled, the following services are granted access to the storage account: Azure Backup, Azure Data Box, Azure DevTest Labs, Azure Event Grid, Azure Event Hubs, Azure File Sync, Azure HDInsight, Azure Import/Export, Azure Monitor, Azure Networking Services, and Azure Site Recovery (when registered in the subscription).;Turning on firewall rules for a storage account will block access to incoming requests for data, including from other Azure services. We can re-enable this functionality by allowing access to `trusted Azure services` through networking exceptions.;This creates authentication credentials for services that need access to storage resources so that services will no longer need to communicate via network request. There may be a temporary loss of communication as you set each Storage Account. It is recommended to not do this on mission-critical resources during business hours.;**Remediate from Azure Portal**1. Go to `Storage Accounts`.1. For each storage account, under `Security + networking`, click `Networking`.1. Click on the `Firewalls and virtual networks` heading.1.

To do this, the private endpoint uses an IP address from the VNet for each service. Network traffic between disparate services securely traverses encrypted over the VNet. This VNet can also link addressing space, extending your network and accessing resources on it. Similarly, it can be a tunnel through public networks to connect remote infrastructures together. This creates further security through segmenting network traffic and preventing outside sources from accessing it.;Securing traffic between services through encryption protects the data from easy interception and reading.;A Private Endpoint costs approximately US$7.30 per month.

The 'Rotation Reminder' is an automatic reminder feature for a manual procedure.;Reminders such as those generated by this recommendation will help maintain a regular and healthy cadence for activities which improve the overall efficacy of a security program. Cryptographic key rotation periods will vary depending on your organization's security requirements and the type of data which is being stored in the Storage Account. For example, PCI DSS mandates that cryptographic keys be replaced or rotated 'regularly,' and advises that keys for static data stores be rotated every 'few months.'For the purposes of this recommendation, 90 days will prescribed for the reminder. Review and adjustment of the 90 day period is recommended, and may even be necessary. Your organization's security requirements should dictate the appropriate setting.;This recommendation only creates a periodic reminder to regenerate access keys.

It is the set of points on the boundary of a system, a system element, system component, or an environment where an attacker can try to enter, cause an effect on, or extract data from, that system, system element, system component, or environment. The larger the attack surface, the harder it is to protect.This tool can be configured to scan your organization's online infrastructure such as specified domains, hosts, CIDR blocks, and SSL certificates, and store them in an Inventory. Inventory items can be added, reviewed, approved, and removed, and may contain enrichments ('insights') and additional information collected from the tool's different scan engines and open-source intelligence sources.A Defender EASM workspace will generate an Inventory of publicly exposed assets by crawling and scanning the internet using _Seeds_ you provide when setting up the tool. Seeds can be FQDNs, IP CIDR blocks, and WHOIS records.Defender EASM will generate Insights within 24-48 hours after Seeds are provided, and these insights include vulnerability data (CVEs), ports and protocols, and weak or expired SSL certificates that could be used by an attacker for reconnaisance or exploitation.Results are classified High/Medium/Low and some of them include proposed mitigations.;This tool can monitor the externally exposed resources of an organization, provide valuable insights, and export these findings in a variety of formats (including CSV) for use in vulnerability management operations and red/purple team exercises.;"Microsoft Defender EASM workspaces are currently available as Azure Resources with a 30-day free trial period but can quickly accrue significant charges.

Estimated cost is not provided within the tool, and users are strongly advised to contact their Microsoft sales representative for pricing and set a calendar reminder for the end of the trial period. For an EASM workspace having an Inventory of 5k-10k billable items (IP addresses, hostnames, SSL certificates, etc) a typical cost might be approximiately $85-170 per day or $2500-5000 USD/month at the time of publication.If the workspace is deleted by the last day of a free trial period, no charges are billed.";To begin remediation, a Microsoft Defender EASM workspace must be created.

Customers who require higher levels of assurance that their data is secure can also enable 256-bit AES encryption at the Azure Storage infrastructure level for double encryption. Double encryption of Azure Storage data protects against a scenario where one of the encryption algorithms or keys may be compromised. Similarly, data is encrypted even before network transmission and in all backups. In this scenario, the additional layer of encryption continues to protect your data. For the most secure implementation of key based encryption, it is recommended to use a Customer Managed asymmetric RSA 2048 Key in Azure Key Vault.;The read and write speeds to the storage will be impacted if both default encryption and Infrastructure Encryption are checked, as a secondary form of encryption requires more resource overhead for the cryptography of information. This performance impact should be considered in an analysis for justifying use of the feature in your environment.

See additional information below for details about the planned retirement of Azure PostgreSQL Single Server.;If Double Encryption is enabled, another layer of encryption is implemented at the hardware level before the storage or network level. Information will be encrypted before it is even accessed, preventing both interception of data in motion if the network layer encryption is broken and data at rest in system resources such as memory or processor cache. Encryption will also be in place for any backups taken of the database, so the key will secure access the data in all forms. For the most secure implementation of key based encryption, it is recommended to use a Customer Managed asymmetric RSA 2048 Key in Azure Key Vault.;The read and write speeds to the database will be impacted if both default encryption and Infrastructure Encryption are checked, as a secondary form of encryption requires more resource overhead for the cryptography of information. This cost is justified for information security.Customer managed keys are recommended for the most secure implementation, leading to overhead of key management.

Resource-level diagnostic logs provide insight into operations that were performed within that resource itself; for example, reading or updating a secret from a Key Vault. Currently, 95 Azure resources support Azure Monitoring (See the more information section for a complete list), including Network Security Groups, Load Balancers, Key Vault, AD, Logic Apps, and CosmosDB. The content of these logs varies by resource type.A number of back-end services were not configured to log and store Resource Logs for certain activities or for a sufficient length. It is crucial that monitoring is correctly configured to log all relevant activities and retain those logs for a sufficient length of time. Given that the mean time to detection in an enterprise is 240 days, a minimum retention period of two years is recommended.";A lack of monitoring reduces the visibility into the data plane, and therefore an organization's ability to detect reconnaissance, authorization attempts or other malicious activity. Unlike Activity Logs, Resource Logs are not enabled by default. Specifically, without monitoring it would be impossible to tell which entities had accessed a data store that was breached. In addition, alerts for failed attempts to access APIs for Web Services or Databases are only possible when logging is enabled.;Costs for monitoring varies with Log Volume. Not every resource needs to have logging enabled. It is important to determine the security classification of the data being processed by the given resource and adjust the logging based on which events need to be tracked. This is typically determined by governance and compliance requirements.;Azure Subscriptions should log every access and operation for all resources.Logs should be sent to Storage and a Log Analytics Workspace or equivalent third-party system. Logs should be kept in readily-accessible storage for a minimum of one year, and then moved to inexpensive cold storage for a duration of time as necessary. If retention policies are set but storing logs in a Storage Account is disabled (for example, if only Event Hubs or Log Analytics options are selected), the retention policies have no effect.

Managed Disks are encrypted by default and recommended for all new VM implementations.**VHD (Virtual Hard Disks) are stored in blob storage and are the old-style disks that were attached to Virtual Machines. The blob VHD was then leased to the VM. By default, storage accounts are not encrypted, and Microsoft Defender will then recommend that the OS disks should be encrypted. Storage accounts can be encrypted as a whole using PMK or CMK. This should be turned on for storage accounts containing VHDs.;While it is recommended to use Managed Disks which are encrypted by default, 'legacy' VHDs may exist for a variety of reasons and may need to remain in VHD format. VHDs are not encrypted by default, so this recommendation intends to address the security of these disks. In these niche cases, VHDs should be encrypted using the procedures in this recommendation to encrypt and protect the data content. If a virtual machine is using a VHD and can be converted to a managed disk, instructions for this procedure can be found in the resources section of this recommendation under the title 'Convert VHD to Managed Disk.;Depending on how the encryption is implemented will change the size of the impact. If provider-managed keys(PMK) are utilized, the impact is relatively low, but processes need to be put in place to regularly rotate the keys. If Customer-managed keys(CMK) are utilized, a key management process needs to be implemented to store and manage key rotation, thus the impact is medium to high depending on user maturity with key management.;**Remediate from Azure Portal** 1.

Access to these 'Secrets' can be controlled through granular permissions.;The credentials given to an application have permissions to create, delete, or modify data stored within the systems they access. If these credentials are stored within the application itself, anyone with access to the application or a copy of the code has access to them. Storing within Azure Key Vault as secrets increases security by controlling access. This also allows for updates of the credentials without redeploying the entire application.;Integrating references to secrets within the key vault are required to be specifically integrated within the application code. This will require additional configuration to be made during the writing of an application, or refactoring of an already written one. There are also additional costs that are charged per 10000 requests to the Key Vault.;"Remediation has 2 steps1. Setup the Key Vault2.

When remote debugging is enabled, it opens a communication channel that could potentially be exploited by unauthorized users if not properly secured.;Disabling remote debugging on Azure App Service is primarily about enhancing security. Remote debugging opens a communication channel that can be exploited by attackers. By disabling it, you reduce the number of potential entry points for unauthorized access.If remote debugging is enabled without proper access controls, it can allow unauthorized users to connect to your application, potentially leading to data breaches or malicious code execution.During a remote debugging session, sensitive information might be exposed. Disabling remote debugging helps ensure that such data remains secure. This minimizes the use of remote access tools to reduce risk.;You will not be able to connect to your application from a remote location to diagnose and fix issues in real-time. You will not be able to step through code, set breakpoints, or inspect variables and the call stack while the application is running on the server. Remote debugging is particularly useful for diagnosing issues that only occur in the production environment.

These locks sit outside of the Role Based Access Controls (RBAC) hierarchy and, when applied, will place restrictions on the resource for all users. These locks are very useful when there is an important resource in a subscription that users should not be able to delete or change. Locks can help prevent accidental and malicious changes or deletion.;As an administrator, it may be necessary to lock a subscription, resource group, or resource to prevent other users in the organization from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources. The lock level can be set to to `CanNotDelete` or `ReadOnly` to achieve this purpose.- `CanNotDelete` means authorized users can still read and modify a resource, but they cannot delete the resource.- `ReadOnly` means authorized users can read a resource, but they cannot delete or update the resource. Applying this lock is similar to restricting all authorized users to the permissions granted by the Reader role.;There can be unintended outcomes of locking a resource. Applying a lock to a parent service will cause it to be inherited by all resources within. Conversely, applying a lock to a resource may not apply to connected storage, leaving it unlocked.

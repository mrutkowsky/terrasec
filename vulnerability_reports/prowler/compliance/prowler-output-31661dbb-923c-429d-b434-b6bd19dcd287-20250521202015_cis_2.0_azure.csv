Metrics and Telemetry data provide organizations with a proactive approach to cost savings by monitoring an application's performance, while the trace logging data provides necessary details in a reactive incident response scenario by helping organizations identify the potential source of an incident within their application.;Because Application Insights relies on a Log Analytics Workspace, an organization will incur additional expenses when using this service.;Remediation Procedures From Azure Portal 1.

Information will be encrypted before it is even accessed, preventing both interception of data in motion if the network layer encryption is broken and data at rest in system resources such as memory or processor cache. Encryption will also be in place for any backups taken of the database, so the key will secure access the data in all forms. For the most secure implementation of key based encryption, it is recommended to use a Customer Managed asymmetric RSA 2048 Key in Azure Key Vault.;The read and write speeds to the database will be impacted if both default encryption and Infrastructure Encryption are checked, as a secondary form of encryption requires more resource overhead for the cryptography of information. This cost is justified for information security. Customer managed keys are recommended for the most secure implementation, leading to overhead of key management. The key will also need to be backed up in a secure location, as loss of the key will mean loss of the information in the database.;It is not possible to enable 'infrastructure double encryption' on an existing Azure Database for PostgreSQL server.

Resource-level diagnostic logs provide insight into operations that were performed within that resource itself; for example, reading or updating a secret from a Key Vault. Currently, 95 Azure resources support Azure Monitoring (See the more information section for a complete list), including Network Security Groups, Load Balancers, Key Vault, AD, Logic Apps, and CosmosDB. The content of these logs varies by resource type. A number of back-end services were not configured to log and store Resource Logs for certain activities or for a sufficient length. It is crucial that monitoring is correctly configured to log all relevant activities and retain those logs for a sufficient length of time. Given that the mean time to detection in an enterprise is 240 days, a minimum retention period of two years is recommended.";A lack of monitoring reduces the visibility into the data plane, and therefore an organization's ability to detect reconnaissance, authorization attempts or other malicious activity. Unlike Activity Logs, Resource Logs are not enabled by default. Specifically, without monitoring it would be impossible to tell which entities had accessed a data store that was breached. In addition, alerts for failed attempts to access APIs for Web Services or Databases are only possible when logging is enabled.;Costs for monitoring varies with Log Volume. Not every resource needs to have logging enabled. It is important to determine the security classification of the data being processed by the given resource and adjust the logging based on which events need to be tracked. This is typically determined by governance and compliance requirements.;Azure Subscriptions should log every access and operation for all resources. Logs should be sent to Storage and a Log Analytics Workspace or equivalent third-party system. Logs should be kept in readily-accessible storage for a minimum of one year, and then moved to inexpensive cold storage for a duration of time as necessary. If retention policies are set but storing logs in a Storage Account is disabled (for example, if only Event Hubs or Log Analytics options are selected), the retention policies have no effect. Enable all monitoring at first, and then be more aggressive moving data to cold storage if the volume of data becomes a cost concern.

Managed Disks are encrypted by default and recommended for all new VM implementations. VHD (Virtual Hard Disks) are stored in blob storage and are the old-style disks that were attached to Virtual Machines. The blob VHD was then leased to the VM. By default, storage accounts are not encrypted, and Microsoft Defender will then recommend that the OS disks should be encrypted. Storage accounts can be encrypted as a whole using PMK or CMK. This should be turned on for storage accounts containing VHDs;While it is recommended to use Managed Disks which are encrypted by default, 'legacy' VHDs may exist for a variety of reasons and may need to remain in VHD format. VHDs are not encrypted by default, so this recommendation intends to address the security of these disks. In these niche cases, VHDs should be encrypted using the procedures in this recommendation to encrypt and protect the data content. If a virtual machine is using a VHD and can be converted to a managed disk, instructions for this procedure can be found in the resources section of this recommendation under the title 'Convert VHD to Managed Disk.';Depending on how the encryption is implemented will change the size of the impact. If provider-managed keys(PMK) are utilized, the impact is relatively low, but processes need to be put in place to regularly rotate the keys. If Customer-managed keys(CMK) are utilized, a key management process needs to be implemented to store and manage key rotation, thus the impact is medium to high depending on user maturity with key management.;From Azure Portal 1. Navigate to the storage account that you wish to encrypt 2. Select encryption 3. Select the encryption type that you wish to use If you wish to use a Microsoft-managed key (the default), you can save at this point and encryption will be applied to the account. If you select Customer-managed keys, it will ask for the location of the key (The default is an Azure Key Vault) and the key name.

These locks sit outside of the Role Based Access Controls (RBAC) hierarchy and, when applied, will place restrictions on the resource for all users. These locks are very useful when there is an important resource in a subscription that users should not be able to delete or change. Locks can help prevent accidental and malicious changes or deletion.;As an administrator, it may be necessary to lock a subscription, resource group, or resource to prevent other users in the organization from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources. The lock level can be set to to CanNotDelete or ReadOnly to achieve this purpose. • CanNotDelete means authorized users can still read and modify a resource, but they cannot delete the resource. • ReadOnly means authorized users can read a resource, but they cannot delete or update the resource. Applying this lock is similar to restricting all authorized users to the permissions granted by the Reader role.;There can be unintended outcomes of locking a resource. Applying a lock to a parent service will cause it to be inherited by all resources within. Conversely, applying a lock to a resource may not apply to connected storage, leaving it unlocked. Please see the documentation for further information.;From Azure Portal 1. Navigate to the specific Azure Resource or Resource Group 2. For each mission critical resource, click on Locks 3. Click Add 4. Give the lock a name and a description, then select the type, Read-only or Delete as appropriate 5. Click OK From Azure CLI To lock a resource, provide the name of the resource, its resource type, and its resource group name. az lock create --name <LockName> --lock-type <CanNotDelete/Read-only> -- resource-group <resourceGroupName> --resource-name <resourceName> --resource- type <resourceType> From Powershell Get-AzResourceLock -ResourceName <Resource Name> -ResourceType <Resource Type> -ResourceGroupName <Resource Group Name> -Locktype <CanNotDelete/Read- only>;From Azure Portal 1. Navigate to the specific Azure Resource or Resource Group 2. Click on Locks 3. Ensure the lock is defined with name and description, with type Read-only or Delete as appropriate.
